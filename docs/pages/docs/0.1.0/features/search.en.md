# Search

Search is an important feature in website documentation, it allows the users to find easily the target content. Engrafia uses the [levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), and [damerau-levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance), it's a tiny but powerful resource to find contents.

The search is based on the title, description, and tags of a document, so, to provide a better experience to the user, you should add a good title, and good descriptions, followed by correct tags, that is not just about a good Engrafia search, but Google and search engines search too.
